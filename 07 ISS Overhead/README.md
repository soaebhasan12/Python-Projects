# ISS Overhead Notifier ðŸš€

A Python automation project that notifies you via email whenever the International Space Station (ISS) is flying above your location at night.

## Features

- Tracks the real-time position of the ISS using the open-notify API
- Checks if the ISS is within Â±5 degrees of your latitude and longitude
- Uses the sunrise-sunset.org API to determine if itâ€™s currently dark at your location
- Sends an email notification when both conditions are met
- Runs automatically every 60 seconds

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) (API calls)
- [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) (time handling)
- [smtplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html) (email automation)
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) (scheduling)

## How It Works

1. Fetches the ISSâ€™s current latitude and longitude.
2. Checks if the ISS is overhead (within Â±5 degrees of your coordinates).
3. Fetches sunrise and sunset times for your location.
4. Determines if itâ€™s currently nighttime.
5. If both conditions are true, sends you an email notification.
6. Repeats the check every 60 seconds.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iss-overhead-notifier.git
   cd iss-overhead-notifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Configure your details:**
   - Set your latitude and longitude in the script.
   - Add your email and an app password (recommended for Gmail).

4. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Notes

- For Gmail, you may need to enable "App Passwords" and allow less secure apps.
- The script runs indefinitely; stop it manually when needed.
- Never share your real email password in public repositories.
